        <p>Having worked in the structural engineering industry and recently completing a rigorous full-stack software engineering intensive program, I aim to leverage my technical background to transition into software development, recognizing its vital role in society. As a problem solver at heart, I have always been drawn to math and logic-based challenges. Professionally, Iâ€™ve worn many hats including project manager, structural analyzer/designer, and tower climber/inspector.</p>
